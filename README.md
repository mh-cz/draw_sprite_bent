# draw_sprite_bent
```draw_sprite_bent(spr, img_index, x, y, around_x, around_y, bend_angle, segments, xscale, yscale, rot, color, alpha, return_pts)```  
  
Simple vertical bend without having to use bones  
  
Don't recommend using too many segments in too many objects because unfrozen vertexes kill fps
  
The green dot is around_x and around_y attached to the mouse cursor  
Adjusting the bend_angle with mouse wheel  
40 segments
